# Epic-Free-Game-Claimer
A tool to automatically claim the Epic Games free game for the week.




# Setup
To setup this project, you first need to download the files for it. To do so, you have 2 options.

1) Click the big green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" in the dropdown.

2) Click the "Releases" text and download the latest ZIP from there. (e.g. Windows-Release.zip)


Once you have the ZIP file, right click and extract all of the files into a directory of your choice. I recommend a memorable location, such as 'C:\EpicClaimer'. We will use this later.
