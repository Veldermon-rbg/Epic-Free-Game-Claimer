# Epic-Free-Game-Claimer
A tool to automatically claim the Epic Games free game for the week.




# Setup
To setup this project, you first need to download the files for it. To do so, you have 2 options.

1) Click the big green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" in the dropdown.

2) Click the "Releases" text and download the latest ZIP from there. (e.g. `Windows-Release.zip`)


Once you have the ZIP file, right click and extract all of the files into a directory of your choice. I recommend a memorable location, such as `C:\EpicClaimer`. We will use this later.
When the files finish extracting, double click on the created folder to enter it. You should see various files, including `epic-games.js` and `run.bat`.

Click on the bar at the top of the window (not on the arrow)

It should select some text. Delete it. Once the bar is empty, type `cmd`, and press enter.

It should open a window similar to that shown here. Type `npm install` in it.
